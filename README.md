## The Process

This application was made to learn web development, I started by gaining camera access and then begain saving the photos into the photostrip. Next step was getting the photostrip to be downloadable, it took a lot of tests with most downloads ending up with just the first photo downloading but eventually I was able to make it so the whole photostrip to download. Then I added a few different frames for people to choose from. Next step will be to add different filters to the camera.
